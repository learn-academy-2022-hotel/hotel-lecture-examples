# REACT STATE

<!--  state - a variable that holds the component's current state of things. -->

## Two types of components
1. Logic: component holding data in a state variable
2. Display:  doesn't hold state - really just there to display 

## useState()
 - react Hook - add state to functional components
 -returns a pair of values:  
  - current state
  - method that updates state
- useState(initialState) - pass the initial state
