# REACT INTRO NOTES 12/9/22

 - Building User Interfaces
 - UI - display and user interaction with application
 - JS library - collection of code snippets to be used in specific ways
 - Component-based - small pieces of code put together to build app
 - Invented by Facebook
 - AirBnb, Netflix, Uber, Yahoo, and many others
 - Uses Yarn as package manager (or npm) - 

 # COMPONENT-BASED
  - build individual components
  - put them together to create app
  - extremely scalable 
  - components are REUSABLE
  - it's UI focused

  - keep it scalable

  - uses functions to create UI elements - then calls on them again again
  - functions return object that holds JSX
  - the object hold data and behavior

  # Functional Components

  - looks JS function, but uses PascalCase for function name.  IMPORTANT!
  - returns JSX - syntax extenstion of JS (basically HTML + JS)

  # DOM
  - Document Object Model - visual representation of your code. 

  - VIRTUAL DOM - this is the key to REACT

  # REACT COMPONENTS
   - function's purpose it to return a value (data)
   - in react - return value of JSX
   - to have it run we have make a COMPONENT CALL 
    - looks like HTML self-colsing tage with PascalCase naming convention
